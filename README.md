# FFNN
Interactive visualization on a fast-forward neural network. To use the web app [https://ffnn.veronikasimmering.de/](https://ffnn.veronikasimmering.de/) and train your own FFNN based on the given Training Data and model parameters. 
The parameters you can specify are:
- Activationfunction
- Learningrate
- Optimizer
- Batchsize
- Training Epochs

## Frameworks:
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
- [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Resources
- [Tenorflow Linear Regression Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/training/linear_regression)

## Testing the model
The model was tested empirically. Thereby an under-fitting model, an over-fitting model, and a best-fitting model were defined. They and their parameters can be viewed in the test section of the web application.


# Code

## Structure
The JavaScript code was separated into different files_
- main.js
- model.js
- data.js
- visual.js
